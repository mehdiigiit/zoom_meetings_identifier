# Usage:
# $ echo INPUT_FILE_NAME | python3 zoom_conns_parser.py > OUTPUT_FILE_NAME
#
# This program analyzes log files of connections to Zoom
# and provides statistical information about Zoom sessions and meetings.
#
# Zoom session = A client's (user) session to Zoom. It consists of
# a group of Zoom connections from the same client all within a specific time duration
# and are attributable to a single session. Every session consists of one persistent TCP
# connection to a MMR server, with possibly at least one UDP connection to the same MMR
# (depending on the client's connectivity method) and more TCP connections to other
# server types for different purposes.
#
# Zoom meeting = A Zoom meeting between at least two clients (sessions)
# serviced by a single Multimedia Router (MMR).
#
# INPUT: The name of the log file in the current directory.
# The log file contains all the connections to the Zoom.
# The format of this file must follow Vertica's standard output
# (delimiter: '|') analyzing Zeek's (Bro) logs.
# Fields must be as the following:
# (1) epoch time
# (2) Originator's IP
# (3) Originator's port
# (4) Responder's IP
# (5) Responder's port
# (6) Protocol
# (7) Zoom server type (mmr, zc, web, xmpp, cdn, rwg, or blank for unknown)
# (8) Duration
# (9) Connection state
# (10) History
# (11) Originator's packets
# (12) Originator's bytes
# (13) Responder's packets
# (14) Responder's bytes.
#
# OUTPUT: The program's output may be stored in the desired given output file.
# The main output of the program includes:
# (1) Number of unique clients (hence identified Zoom sessions)
# (2) Number of unique client IPs
# (3) Number of unique MMRs
# (4) Number of all connections to MMRs
# (5) Number of Zoom meetings
# (6) Average number of MMR connections per client
# (7) Average number of distinct clients per IP
# (8) List of all the Zoom sessions, with their timings and different connections
# (9) List of all the Zoom meetings, with their timings and number of users
#
# Besides the main output, this program records the number of connections to each
# type of Zoom server from each Zoom session in separate files (named as distribution_TYPE.txt),
# as well as the timings (start and end) of all TCP and UDP connections to MMRs
# (also in separate files named as timings_tcp.txt and timings_udp.txt),
# for use in further analysis and visualizations.
